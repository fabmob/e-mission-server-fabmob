e-mission phone app [FABMOB]

This is the README for e-mission-phone FabMob

The description and docs of the "Traceur de MobilitÃ©s" project for FabMob are here : https://oultim.frama.site/

The full original README for e-mission-server is here : https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-server/blob/master/README.md

See also the e-mission doc repo here : https://github.com/fabmob/e-mission-docs/

Our modifications from the e-mission-server master branch are twofold :
- configuration
- use of the e-mission-server/gis-based-mode-detection branch (which matches trips to the public transit)
